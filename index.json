However, the predictions can be driven by confounding variables unrelated to the signal of interest, such as scanner effect or head motion, limiting the clinical usefulness and interpretation of machine learning models. The most common method to control for confounding effects is regressing out the confounding variables separately from each input variable before machine learning modeling. However, we show that this method is insufficient because machine learning models can learn information from the data that cannot be regressed out. Instead of regressing out confounding effects from each input variable, we propose controlling for confounds post-hoc on the level of machine learning predictions. This allows partitioning of the predictive performance into the performance that can be explained by confounds and performance independent of confounds. This approach is flexible and allows for parametric and non-parametric confound adjustment. We show in real and simulated data that this method correctly controls for confounding effects even when traditional input variable adjustment produces false-positive findings.","tags":null,"title":"Controlling for effects of confounding variables on machine learning predictions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Richard Dinga","Brenda W.J.H.

Regardless of the application, the most commonly used method to quantify model performance is to calculate prediction accuracy, i.e. the proportion of correctly classified samples. While simple and intuitive, other performance measures are often more appropriate with respect to many common goals of neuroimaging pattern recognition studies. In this paper, we will review alternative performance measures and focus on their interpretation and practical aspects of model evaluation. Specifically, we will focus on 4 families of performance measures: 1) categorical performance measures such as accuracy, 2) rank based performance measures such as the area under the curve, 3) probabilistic performance measures based on quadratic error such as Brier score, and 4) probabilistic performance measures based on information criteria such as logarithmic score. We will examine their statistical properties in various settings using simulated data and real neuroimaging data derived from public datasets. Results showed that accuracy had the worst performance with respect to statistical power, detecting model improvement, selecting informative features and reliability of results. Therefore in most cases, it should not be used to make statistical inference about model performance. Accuracy should also be avoided for evaluating utility of clinical models, because it does not take into account clinically relevant information, such as relative cost of false-positive and false-negative misclassification or calibration of probabilistic predictions. We recommend alternative evaluation criteria with respect to the goals of a specific machine learning model.","tags":null,"title":"Beyond accuracy: Measures for assessing machine learning models, pitfalls and guidelines","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Academic is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

A possible approach to dissect biological heterogeneity is to look for biologically meaningful subtypes. A recent study Drysdale et al. (2017) showed promising results along this line by simultaneously using resting state fMRI and clinical data and identified four distinct subtypes of depression with different clinical profiles and abnormal resting state fMRI connectivity. These subtypes were predictive of treatment response to transcranial magnetic stimulation therapy. Objective: Here, we attempted to replicate the procedure followed in the Drysdale et al. study and their findings in a different clinical population and a more heterogeneous sample of 187 participants with depression and anxiety. We aimed to answer the following questions: 1) Using the same procedure, can we find a statistically significant and reliable relationship between brain connectivity and clinical symptoms? 2) Is the observed relationship similar to the one found in the original study? 3) Can we identify distinct and reliable subtypes? 4) Do they have similar clinical profiles as the subtypes identified in the original study? Methods: We followed the original procedure as closely as possible, including a canonical correlation analysis to find a low dimensional representation of clinically relevant resting state fMRI features, followed by hierarchical clustering to identify subtypes. We extended the original procedure using additional statistical tests, to test the statistical significance of the relationship between resting state fMRI and clinical data, and the existence of distinct subtypes. Furthermore, we examined the stability of the whole procedure using resampling. Results and conclusion: As in the original study, we found extremely high canonical correlations between functional connectivity and clinical symptoms, and an optimal three-cluster solution. However, neither canonical correlations nor clusters were statistically significant. On the basis of our extensive evaluations of the analysis methodology used and within the limits of comparison of our sample relative to the sample used in Drysdale et al., we argue that the evidence for the existence of the distinct resting state connectivity-based subtypes of depression should be interpreted with caution.","tags":["Anxiety","Clustering","Machine learning","Major depressive disorder","Replication"],"title":"Evaluating the evidence for biotypes of depression: Methodological replication and extension of Drysdale et al.

These findings, however, are based on group comparisons with unknown translational value. This study evaluated the prognostic value of a wide range of clinical, psychological, and biological characteristics for predicting the course of depression and aimed to identify the best set of predictors. Eight hundred four unipolar depressed patients (major depressive disorder or dysthymia) patients were assessed on a set involving 81 demographic, clinical, psychological, and biological measures and were clinically followed-up for 2 years. Subjects were grouped according to (i) the presence of a depression diagnosis at 2-year follow-up (yes n‚Äâ=‚Äâ397, no n‚Äâ=‚Äâ407), and (ii) three disease course trajectory groups (rapid remission, n‚Äâ=‚Äâ356, gradual improvement n‚Äâ=‚Äâ273, and chronic n‚Äâ=‚Äâ175) identified by a latent class growth analysis. A penalized logistic regression, followed by tight control over type I error, was used to predict depression course and to evaluate the prognostic value of individual variables. Based on the inventory of depressive symptomatology (IDS), we could predict a rapid remission course of depression with an AUROC of 0.69 and 62% accuracy, and the presence of an MDD diagnosis at follow-up with an AUROC of 0.66 and 66% accuracy. Other clinical, psychological, or biological variables did not significantly improve the prediction. Among the large set of variables considered, only the IDS provided predictive value for course prediction on an individual level, although this analysis represents only one possible methodological approach. However, accuracy of course prediction was moderate at best and further improvement is required for these findings to be clinically useful.","tags":null,"title":"Predicting the naturalistic course of depression from a wide range of clinical, psychological, and biological data: a machine learning approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"d1311ddf745551c9e117aa4bb7e28516","permalink":"/project/external-project/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/external-project/","section":"project","summary":"An example of linking directly to an external project website using `external_link`.","tags":["Demo"],"title":"External Project","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
